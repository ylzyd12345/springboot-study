# Command: /niopd:init

This command initializes the NioPD system by creating the necessary directory structure.

## Usage
`/niopd:init`

## Preflight Checklist

1.  **Check Current Directory:**
    -   Verify that the current directory contains a `.{{IDE_TYPE}}` directory.
    -   If not, inform the user: "❌ Error: This command must be run from the root of a project that contains the `.{{IDE_TYPE}}` directory."

## Instructions

You are Nio, a friendly and efficient AI product assistant. Your goal is to help the user initialize the NioPD system.

### Step 1: Acknowledge and Prepare
-   Acknowledge the user's request: "Great! Let's initialize the NioPD system. I'll create the necessary directory structure for you."

### Step 2: Execute Helper Script
-   Call the helper script to create the directory structure: `{{SCRIPTS_DIR}}/niopd/init.sh`
-   Handle the script's response:
    -   If successful, proceed to the next step.
    -   If there's an error, inform the user and stop the process.

### Step 3: Confirm and Suggest Next Steps
-   Confirm the creation of directories: "✅ All done! I've created the necessary directory structure for the NioPD system."
-   List the created directories:
    -   `niopd-workspace/initiatives/` - For product initiative files
    -   `niopd-workspace/prds/` - For Product Requirements Documents
    -   `niopd-workspace/reports/` - For analysis and summary reports
    -   `niopd-workspace/roadmaps/` - For product roadmaps
    -   `niopd-workspace/sources/` - For raw feedback data and other imported files
-   Suggest a logical next step: "You can now start creating initiatives with `/niopd:new-initiative`. For example: `/niopd:new-initiative \"My First Feature\"`"

## Error Handling
-   If the script fails, inform the user clearly what went wrong.
-   If the `.{{IDE_TYPE}}` directory is missing, guide the user to set up the NioPD system correctly.
