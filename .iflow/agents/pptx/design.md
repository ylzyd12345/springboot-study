# Taobao Group 2026 Campus Recruitment Presentation Design

## Color Palette Selection

For Taobao Group, I'll use a modern color scheme that reflects the brand while being visually appealing:

1. **Taobao Orange**: #FF6A00 (Primary brand color)
2. **Deep Blue**: #1E3A8A (Secondary color for contrast and professionalism)
3. **Light Gray**: #F3F4F6 (Background and subtle elements)
4. **Dark Gray**: #4B5563 (Text and secondary elements)
5. **White**: #FFFFFF (Clean, modern feel)

## Typography

Using web-safe fonts as required:
- **Headers**: Arial, bold (strong and clear)
- **Body Text**: Arial (readable and professional)
- **Accent Elements**: Trebuchet MS (for a modern touch)

## Design Principles

1. **Modern and Clean**: Plenty of white space, clear hierarchy
2. **Brand Consistency**: Use of Taobao's signature orange
3. **Visual Hierarchy**: Clear distinction between headers and body text
4. **Professional Tone**: Appropriate for a corporate recruitment presentation
5. **Readability**: High contrast between text and backgrounds
